# Intro

This repository contains all of my advent of code submissions. I started this repository in 2022. Solutions range in quality, efficiency and implementation language depending on what I was focusing on at the time. Sometimes it's to learn a new language, to practice performance engineering or test out new algorithms/data structures. I've included a highlight reel before for solutions of particular note

## Highlight Reel

1. For [Year 2022 Problem Five](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5), I implemented a state machine in python that allowed me to process information line by line. We never have to load the whole file into memory, so it's quite efficient in that aspect. [State Machine](2022/5/main.py)
2. For [Year 2022 Problem 10](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10), the problem asked for a unique visualization that required modeling a CRT TV. [CRT TV](2022/10/main.py)
3. For [Year 2022 Problem 18](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/18), we were tasked with calculating the surface area for an arbitrary volume. It reminded me of the fable of the discovery of the "Archimedes Principle" where the great scientist discovered that you could determine the buoyancy of an object by the amount of water it displaced. Apparently he sat in a bath and noticed that the water overflowing. So I submerged this "volume" into a bounding rectangular prism of determined external surface area. The surface are of the volume was simply TOTAL SURFACE AREA - EXTERNAL SURFACE AREA. [Archimedes](2022/18/main.py)
